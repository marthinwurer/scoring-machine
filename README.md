# An Arduino Scoring Machine
This is a scoring machine built using an Arduino Uno (ATMega328P-PU). 
It works pretty great, and we've used it at club practices for a few weeks, and had no issues.

Epee works 100%. Foil works 100%. Saber needs whipover and better timing, so 75%. 

Main code needs a good refactor, but it works!
